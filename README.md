## 5. SonarQube included.

In order to maintain the quality of your code and your project, we include SonarQube on this repository.
You can install in two minutes using the SonarQube tutorial available here: 
https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Get+Started+in+Two+Minutes

Once the SonarQube platform has been installed, you're ready to install and analyse your project. First, run your local server:
http://localhost:9000/about

And then, run the project in order to check the code quality:

```bash
mvn clean verify sonar:sonar
```

## 6. Run SonarQube on a Docker easily.

In case you don't want to install SonarQube on your local machine, you can run sonar remotely using <b>Docker</b>. 

You have two choices to create your own Docker:

1) Create a new instance on: http://labs.play-with-docker.com/. 
It's free, easy to use and you don't need to install anything on your computer. 

2) Download Docker from its official Website: https://www.docker.com/
Download, install Docker and run everything you need. 

Once you have Docker, you need to run the followings lines:

```bash
docker pull sonarqube
docker run -d --name sonarqube -p 9000:9000 sonarqube
```

And then, you are ready to run SonarQube:

```bash
mvn clean install sonar:sonar
```
